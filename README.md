# Tech Quiz Application

This full-stack MERN Tech Quiz application was provided as a fully functional starter codebase by the DU Coding Bootcamp course. It allows users to take a quiz of ten random tech-related questions and view their final score upon completion.

For this project, I focused on enhancing the application’s reliability by creating a comprehensive suite of **Cypress tests**, including both component and end-to-end coverage. These tests ensure the app performs as expected and maintains robustness across user interactions.
